1. test if unit and system tests pass: make test; make integration_test
2. update version number: poetry version <major/minor/patch>
3. add information to changelog on master: git log --pretty="%s"
4. commit and push to master on github using a commit message "Ready for vx.x.x"
   this automatically triggers a GitHub actions workflow that builds and publishes the packages to TestPyPI and PyPI
6. create a branch on github with the version number
